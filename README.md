# Health Helper ðŸ©º

A personal health tracker built with **Next.js**, **MobX**, and **Prisma**.

## What It Does

The app helps to keep track of personal medical history in one place:

- structured anamnesis and health background
- past lab results, diagnostics, and documents
- doctor visits and treatments

Designed for real-world use â€” and built as a developer playground to explore fullstack architecture.
This is both a **practical tool** for managing real medical records and a **pet project** for practicing modern frontend/backend workflows.

## Stack Highlights

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14
- **State Management:** MobX
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Prisma), hosted on Neon
- **Styling:** Material UI

## Status
